first jenkins project iiiiiis a basic CI server focused on change management for Network Configs.

It has 3 parts


1. The config pusher
2. The CI function
3. The email service

1. the config pusher is reliant on netmiko
2. the CI function is based on using a JSON file to check for banned items.
   There are a few major sections that direct the code to do stuff.
        A. Reject
        B. Replace
        C. Required
3. The email service emails when there is a rejection, or when the service is down.
